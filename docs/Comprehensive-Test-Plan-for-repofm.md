## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Test Organization**
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Group related tests together
   - Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup/cleanup
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use fixtures for test data

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for >80% code coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Include edge cases
   - Test error conditions
   - Test configuration variations

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Vitest for unit and integration tests
   - Coverage reporting with v8
   - Mock file system operations
   - Mock network operations
   - Use fixtures for test data

4. **Best Practices**
   - Write independent tests
   - Use meaningful assertions
   - Clean up test resources
   - Document test scenarios
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

## Test Execution

1. **Local Development**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test-coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/core/file/fileCollect.test.ts
```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**

```bash
# Full test suite
npm run test

# Coverage reports
npm run test-coverage

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update test cases for new features
   - Review and update test data
   - Maintain test documentation
   - Monitor test performance
   - Update mock data

2. **Coverage Monitoring**
   - Track coverage trends
   - Identify untested code
   - Add missing test cases
   - Review test quality
   - Update test strategies

## Notes

1. This test plan covers both existing and planned features of repofm.
2. Tests should be added incrementally, prioritizing core functionality.
3. Each test category should have its own directory and test files.
4. Use appropriate mocking strategies for external dependencies.
5. Maintain test fixtures separate from test code.
